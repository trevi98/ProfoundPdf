<br><br>

<br>

------

## Installation

### 1. Install package using composer
```shell
composer require mostafaznv/nova-ckeditor
```

### 2. Publish config, migrations, models, resources and snippets
```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mostafaznv\NovaCkEditor\FieldServiceProvider"
```

### 3. Prepare migration and models
After publishing stubs, there will be Image and Video classes in `app/Models` and `app/Nova/Resources` directories. these classes are essential for `media-picker` used in ckeditor field.

#### Image
You should create a disk in `config/filesystems.php`:

```
'disks' => [
    'image' => [
        'driver'     => 'local',
        'root'       => public_path('uploads/image'),
        'url'        => env('APP_URL') . 'uploads/image',
    ]
]
```
> **Note**: If you want to change the disk name, you should rename it in `App\Nova\Resources\Image` class too. second argument of make function in `ImageUpload` field is the disk name

#### Video
This package uses [nova-video](https://github.com/mostafaznv/nova-video) to handle videos, so you can choose between [larupload](https://github.com/mostafaznv/larupload) and laravel's built-in  file-system to handle upload process.

1. Create a disk in `config/filesystems.php`:
```
'disks' => [
    'video' => [
        'driver'     => 'local',
        'root'       => public_path('uploads/video'),
        'url'        => env('APP_URL') . 'uploads/video',
    ]
]
```

> **Note**: If you want to change the disk name, you should rename it in these places: <br>
> **- With Larupload**: In `App\Models\Video` (disk function of `Attachment` class) <br>
> **- Without Larupload**: In `App\Nova\Resources\Model` (third argument of make function in `VideoUpload` field) 


>**Note**: Larupload uses **FFMPEG** to generate cover from original video file, and it will try to find the FFMPEG binary path from your system's environment. but you can define it by yourself by publishing larupload config file. <br> `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mostafaznv\Larupload\LaruploadServiceProvider"` 

2. Prepare migration and model:
   1. In the case you chose larupload, there is nothing to do with migration and model. you can find more configuration options in [nova-video](https://github.com/mostafaznv/nova-video) and [larupload](https://github.com/mostafaznv/larupload) documentations.
   2. But if you chose laravel's file-system, you must make some changes in migration and model. You should remove larupload **trait** and **attachments function** from model and use **string column** instead of **upload column** in migration file.
      
Migration
```
class CreateVideosTable extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('videos', function(Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('name')->index();
        $table->string('file')->index(); // in case that you don't want Larupload
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```
Model
```
class Video extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'file', 'disk'];

    protected static function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();

        self::saving(function($model) {
            $hasLaruploadTrait = method_exists(self::class, 'bootLarupload');

            if (!$model->name) {
                $name = $hasLaruploadTrait ? $model->file->meta('name') : $model->file;

                $model->name = pathinfo($name, PATHINFO_FILENAME);
            }
        });
    }
}
```


### 4. Migrate
```shell
php artisan migrate
```


------

## Usage
Now you can add `CkEditor` field into your resource fields:

```php
use Mostafaznv\NovaCkEditor\CkEditor;

class Article extends Resource
{
    public function fields(Request $request): array
    {
        return [
            ID::make()->sortable(),

            Text::make(trans('Title'), 'title')->rules('required', 'max:255'),

            CkEditor::make(trans('Content'), 'content')->stacked()
        ];
    }
}
```

------

## Some Notes 

> Video and Image file fields are **not updatable** by default. replacing media may result in broken links. so delete and re-upload is the intended methodology.

> You can override the `ImageStorage` service by binding your own extended version:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Mostafaznv\NovaCkEditor\ImageStorage;

class MyImageStorage extends ImageStorage
{
    public function __invoke(Request $request)
    {
        // TODO: Change the default implementation.
    }
}

$this->app->bind('ckeditor-image-storage', MyImageStorage::class);
```
